# Introduction

Startup fundraising is not easy. Maintaining your enthusiasm and passion for the seed of an idea while you rebound from one investor to the next is exhausting. It is a process that's killed hundreds of startups. At BaseTemplates, we aim to help founders and startup teams launch their ventures successfully with one powerful, affordable pitch deck solution.

But providing you with just a template? Well, that's like giving you a plane without teaching you to fly. So, we created this helpful book to walk you through the basics, introducing the concept of the pitch deck, its advantages and uses, as well as providing advice and support on planning, design, pitching and choosing investors. Your brilliant idea is just a pitch deck away from becoming a successful startup. Let’s make it happen!

Max & Julian,
Founders of BaseTemplates

# The Pitch Deck

Startup financing is changing rapidly and it is no longer entirely dependent on angel investors and venture capitals. With crowdfunding platforms and new financial technology emerging all the time, entrepreneurs now have more options for financing than ever before. But one thing remains certain, whatever your seeding round looks like, your business should start life as a pitch deck.

# Chapter 1. The Pitch Deck

# Purpose of a Pitch Deck

A pitch deck is a short presentation, a visual breakdown of your business model. It is usually created in PowerPoint or Keynote and delivered in a PDF format. Your pitch should tell a story; it should excite potential investors, giving them the information they need to decide whether to risk their capital on your startup.

Creative and flexible, a pitch deck can be quickly revised, making it easy to adjust the business model to the needs of a changing market or tailor the pitch to specific investors.

# The Pitch Deck vs. The Business Plan

# Chapter 1. The Pitch Deck

The traditional business plan was once the gold standard for seeding rounds. It provided investors with detailed forecasts, carefully planning every aspect of a startup launch and predicting returns years into the future.

Shorter than a business plan, a pitch deck delivers only the most relevant information. It is not a detailed plan of growth but a brief introduction to a business that's full of potential. You'll only see financial forecasts, competitor, and market research in around two-thirds of pitch decks. Instead, investor pitches focus on the idea, the problem that idea solves, and the team that will make it a reality.

When you are creating your first pitch deck, it's important to understand the difference between planning your business and pitching it. A pitch focuses on the possibilities; a plan on the details. Pitches adapt to changes in the market; plans try to predict those changes.

Your pitch deck should paint a picture of the world your product will create.

# Chapter 1. The Pitch Deck

# Your Venture's First Prototype

A pitch deck isn't just for securing funding. Writing your ideas down, defining your business and summarizing all that you want to achieve in less than 20 slides forces you to consider how practical your idea really is. It highlights any initial problems, gives you an opportunity to find solutions, and strengthens your business model. In the early stages of a startup, there is no faster or cheaper way to build your business than a pitch deck.

A pitch deck is a prototype for your venture. It provides enough detail for other people to quickly understand your idea, allowing your friends, family, and colleagues to offer relevant advice, identify obstacles and suggest improvements. This type of presentation can be swiftly and easily adapted to incorporate new ideas, so when you do come to launch your business, you have a strong prototype and the best possible chance of success.

# Elements

“You have a very short amount of time to make a first impression. If you've got a long rambling slide deck… you're done.”

- Naval Ravikant, Co-founder AngelList
---
# Chapter 2. Elements

It is important to understand your audience and deliver a pitch that meets their expectations. Some investors will want information on market size and opportunity; others will appreciate customer acquisition data and milestones. To address this, most startups have a basic pitch deck template that includes the essential slides – business model, problem, solution and team – with additional deck slides added to meet the needs of individual investors.

The best pitch decks use less than 20 slides. The order each slide appears in your presentation is your choice, but most ventures will place their team pages at the beginning or end of the pitch deck. However, experts like Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn) recommend that you open your pitch with the investment thesis and leave the team page until the end.

To help you understand each pitch deck element, we will be pitching some existing (and a few fictional) BaseTemplates products to you. Each slide you see has been created with our amazing Pitch Deck Template.

# Essential Slides

While every pitch deck is unique, there are ten slides that should feature in every investor pitch: Title, Summary, The Problem, The Solution, The Business Model, Market Size, Customer Acquisition, Competition, The Team and The Ask. Let’s have a closer look at each one.

# Chapter 2. Elements

# Title Slide

The title slide is your first and last impression. It will be displayed behind you while you introduce yourself and could be used as a backdrop when you thank your audience for their time, so it is likely to be the most viewed slide in your pitch. Title slides must be eye-catching and memorable, keep the design simple and make sure it includes your logo.

The best examples of title slides are engaging and straightforward. They deliver a visual overview of the business model and use a catchy tagline to state the mission of the company. While not essential, we always recommend including a date on your title slide as well, since this makes it easier to identify different versions of your pitch deck.

# Summary/Overview

The summary slide provides a brief outline of your business. It should detail the problem you see and your solution. This is a very short slide that is designed to make investors curious about your business. Don't be afraid to make big claims; investors want to see that you are passionate and invested in bringing your idea to life. Keep it simple, explain what your business does in 30 words or less.

# The Problem

This is one of the most important slides in your deck. It shows investors how relevant your product is and provides a glimpse into your market. You need your audience to agree with this slide, so keep the design simple and tell them a story while they're looking at it. A tale about a person who benefits from using your product will highlight its relevance.

If your business doesn't solve a problem – many restaurants and consumer goods shops won't – then you may want to swap the problem deck slide for the opportunity slide instead.

# The Solution

By now, your investors should understand the significance of the problem. They should be invested in the idea of helping you fix it, so the solution you present must be innovative, exciting and memorable. If you have a prototype, now is the time to show it off. If you are pitching a concept, include videos, pictures and illustrations. Encourage investors to ask questions and make sure your audience fully understands your solution. If investors in one pitch struggle to understand the concept, be sure to adjust the slide so that it is clearer for your next pitch.

# The Business Model

The business model deck slide describes to investors how you will make money. This slide doesn't need to include detailed data and financial forecasts, but it should show that you have used revenue, earnings and profit projections to help shape your business model.

The best examples of these slides are not data-heavy. They use simple statistics like revenue or market share to highlight how profitable the business could be. The slides themselves will lack detailed facts and figures, but be prepared for investors to ask about the statistics and calculations you used to produce them and make sure you know these answers ahead of your pitch.

# The Market/The Opportunity (Why Now)

The opportunity and market slides provide similar information, and you are unlikely to need both in the same pitch. The opportunity slide describes how your business will operate within your industry, the market slide describes the current market. Both can be used to explain why now is the best time to launch and might include market trends, the size of the market and growth potential. The purpose of these slides is to demonstrate that your business has a future and that you know the market and opportunities better than anyone else.

# Customer Acquisition (Go To Market)

Think of this slide as a description of your 'go-to' market. This is where you explain who your customers are and how well you know them. Describe your market, advertising channels, and location. Don't forget to show investors how many potential customers you are targeting. Some founders will use this slide to demonstrate the size or value of the potential market; others might include the costs associated with customer acquisition. The important thing to remember is that the best examples can be read and understood in three seconds or less. Maps, diagrams and headline statistics all work well and grab your audience's attention.

# Competition

The purpose of this deck slide is to demonstrate that you know your industry and can provide an honest assessment of how your company fits into that industry. Include information on other businesses and services that will be competing for the same customers. Don't ignore major competitors to make your business look stronger, instead, focus on your strengths and highlight your competitive advantages. Investors want to see that you have considered every potential obstacle and have a plan to overcome it.

Keeping a competition slide simple can be difficult, especially if you have many competitors. Plotting the key features of your product on an x and y-axis and using it to compare your services with those offered by your competitors is a tested format.

# The Team

The team slide provides an introduction to each of the key team members. Investors want to see relevant skills and experience; they need to have confidence in your team and your ability to make the venture a success. Keep bios short and to the point (you can always provide an accompanying document with longer introductions) and highlight any key skills that are essential to the business. Some of the best examples of team deck slides are short. They include professional headshots of the main team members and brief introductions – sometimes as simple as three or four key pieces of information i.e. name, position, and biggest professional achievement. Don't be afraid to be creative with this slide; it needs to make an impression.

# The Ask

This slide is about defining what you need from investors and what you will provide in return. Data oriented pitches might include acquisition targets, plans for initial public offerings and details about how the company can be sold. A concept pitch deck is more likely to focus on the business and how you will use investments to drive growth. Whatever style you chose, the ask slide should clearly state what size and type of investment you are looking for and what that investment will deliver (i.e. the milestones you can achieve with it or the resources it will buy). Remember that money isn't the only contribution your audience can make to your startup. Advice, friendship, and expertise are just as critical to making your business a success.

# Optional Slides

When deciding which slides are essential to your pitch deck, consider whether you are pitching data or a concept. A concept pitch is best suited to a new and innovative product; you are pitching a vision of the future and your plan to make it a reality. These decks might include additional slides such as the vision, mission, and product.

If you are on your second or third seeding round, or are pitching a business model that already has data to support it, then a data pitch could be more appropriate. This gives investors the opportunity to judge your business based on the strength of the available data and will include additional slides such as financials and traction.

# Chapter 2. Elements

# Contact

Strictly speaking, the contact slide is optional. Many of the best pitch deck examples don't include one and instead choose to put an email address on the summary slide or in the footer of other deck slides. While investors will already have your contact information, it may not be readily available to every member of the investment team. If an executive is looking over your pitch deck after your meeting, a contact slide makes it easy for them to ask questions and seek additional information. We recommend including at least two forms of contact information (for example, an email address and a phone number) on the contact slide. This is also the perfect place to showcase any social media accounts the business has.

# The Product

The product slide is very similar to the solution slide and can be helpful for further explaining your product, particularly if you don't yet have a prototype.

Use this slide to describe your product in more detail but don't repeat information from the solution slide. Instead, focus on manufacturing timetables, supplier relationships, variations in the product (i.e. size or color) and any patents you own or have pending on the design. These features all add value to your business and demonstrate that your product is viable and competitive.

# Traction

The traction slide exists to tell investors how successful you already are. Its purpose is to make them feel like your idea will succeed with or without their backing. This is the part of the pitch deck where you show that your assumptions about the market are correct and demonstrate how efficient your team already is.

# Milestones

A milestone slide celebrates your most important achievements. It shows investors that you are already creating momentum and driving your business forward.

For those in the early stages of developing their startup, the milestone slide can be used to provide a road map, showing investors and your staff what the next step is. This is an easy way to plan ahead and shows how you intend to make your venture a success.

# Financials

Financials normally include a balance sheet, income, and cash flow statements. Around 58% of pitch decks include a financials slide, which is of more interest to investors if you have launched or have already conducted a seeding round. Businesses just starting out are not usually expected to display financials.

Financial deck slides do not take a standard form. Some startups will use them to showcase how much they raised during their first seeding round or to list potential buyers for an exit strategy. Others might skip this slide altogether and include an income statement on their traction slide instead, highlighting their venture's success so far.

# Exit Strategies

Some companies never recover from the loss of a founding CEO and investors want to know how you plan to ensure your business can survive without you. The exit strategy slide details plans for exit options such as acquisition or IPO, and might include a list of potential buyers.

# The Mission and The Vision

The mission statement is a short, simple slide at the beginning or end of the pitch deck that explains why your company exists. At the prototype stage, the mission slide provides direction for you and your team. During a seeding round, it provides investors with insight into the idea that is driving your venture forward.

A vision slide is a great addition to any concept pitch. It describes the world your product will help to create or your long-term plan for your business. It shows investors that you have a firm idea of how the business will grow.

It's 2018.

# Partnerships

It takes more than money to launch a startup, investors want to see who is involved in the project. The partnership slide is not a common slide, but it can be very valuable.

Include information on any industry experts you are consulting with, as well as strategic relationships with contractors or suppliers that might lower your overheads or help you break into new markets. If you already have backers invested, or have backers from previous successful funding rounds, then include this information as well. If you are associated with a prestigious accelerator program, then now would be the time to showcase that relationship.

The important thing with this deck slide is to only include partners that offer a strategic benefit; including every family member who has invested will draw focus from the more powerful partners who will drive your success and impress investors. Don't forget to check with your partners – particularly financial backers – that they are happy for you to publicize their involvement.

# Chapter 3. Story

A pitch is about more than the slides you choose and how well they are presented. If you're going to turn your pitch deck into a valuable asset, you need a story.

# Why Is The Story Important?

When you're looking for startup funding, remember, stories are easier to recall than facts and figures. A great story will create an emotional link between your business and your investors, highlight the effectiveness of your solution and show them how well you know your audience.

Your narrative should explain each of your slides, linking them together to tell the story of your venture. You can use characters or elements from your story to answer investors' questions or add personality to a reading deck (we'll discuss these in more detail in next chapter).

# How To Tell Your Story

A pitch deck story should have the same elements as a good book – action, excitement, success, and failure. You should include as many details as you can and work hard to get the audience on your side. By the end of your pitch, investors should care about your venture.

We've provided three examples of a pitch deck story. Each highlights different features of the enterprise and can be tailored to meet the needs of particular investors.

# The Hero’s Journey

This is a classic story that follows a tried and tested format:

1. Our hero is living a normal life, unaware that anything is wrong.
2. He encounters a problem that cannot be fixed with the tools available to him.
3. He sets about building a solution no one has thought of before.
4. He finds his purpose and dedicates himself to solving that problem. It's a goal that continues to motivate him to this day.

This is the tale of why you decided to launch your startup. It is personal; it explains where you have come from and what is motivating you. It is the best format for innovative concept pitches, new products and

charities, since it creates a bond between you and your audience, highlighting your experience and showcasing your passion for the project.

# BaseTemplates: A Hero's Journey

The BaseTemplates story begins with a student named Max. Touring industry conferences, watching hundreds of presentations, Max noticed two things; ugly slide decks are everywhere, and even the best speeches are ruined by poor presentations. So he set to work fixing it.

As a freelance Presentation Designer, Max solved the problem one deck at a time. He turned boring slides full of bullet-points into entertaining presentations. He helped startups deliver clear messages, and made great looking pitches for industry leaders. But one man can only do so much, and ugly pitch decks were still everywhere he looked.

Then he had an idea. What if he could create a smart template, specific to every business and able to meet the needs of individuals? A template that worked perfectly on both PowerPoint and Keynote, with great slide design and helpful visual assets? Today he is launching BaseTemplates, the all-in-one solution that's set to put an end to ugly presentations everywhere.

# The Customer’s Tale

This story focuses on your product from your customer's perspective. It is an excellent way to secure startup funding since it shows investors.

that you know your market and highlights the value of your product to real people. The basic format of the customer's tale:

1. Introduce someone with a problem.
2. Describe his everyday life and the options he explored to fix his problem.
3. Explain how he discovered your product and how it solves the issue.
4. Show investors the difference your product has made to this customer.

Another excellent choice for concept decks, the customer's tale also works very well for those pitching consumer goods and tech startups. It demonstrates your advantage over competitors.

# BaseTemplates: The Customer's Tale

Hans and Katie spent two years developing Legion - a plugin that accurately translates email content into three languages. They funded the beta tests themselves and developed a working prototype to take to investors. They developed an excellent network during their testing phase and secured meetings with three angel investors quickly. But explaining their concept and capturing the attention of investors was difficult, and they struggled to secure funding - until a contact introduced them to BaseTemplates.

Within a day, they had completely re-designed their presentation. The advanced

Visual effects, icons, images and layouts meant that their deck now accurately showcased their startup. This was the deck investors expected from them, and it was this deck that helped them close their seeding round five weeks later having secured the $150,000 they needed.

# The Industry Point of View

This is the tale of your industry and why it needs you. This story shows investors that your startup has a role to play and demonstrates how well you know your market and current industry trends. The industry point of view:

1. The industry has always operated according to a set of assumptions based on the environment it grew up in.
2. Technological, economic or social changes mean that these assumptions simply don't hold true anymore, causing problems for the big players in the industry.
3. This problem creates a unique opportunity for a new business to step in and take advantage of these changes.
4. This is the perfect time for that business – your business – to launch. Demonstrate to investors that you understand the impact your product will have. They need to know your venture will be a success with or without them.

This format works especially well for data pitches and ground-breaking startups. It demonstrates your competitive edge, how your business will fit into the wider industry, and the size of your potential customer base.

# BaseTemplates: An Industry Point of View

Today, there are over 1000 online stores selling presentation templates. Each store sells hundreds of templates, and they all look the same; fancy slide designs, fonts, and animations. But how many are really useful? Most founders don't know which template is best suited to their business. Some templates don't work properly on Mac; others require customers to buy additional design elements. In short, building engaging, professional presentations with them is hard.

That's where BaseTemplates comes in. An all-in-one template that meets the needs of every business or presentation, with great design and visual assets at no extra cost, and easy customization in both PowerPoint or Keynote. Now, presentation creators don't need to download additional resources and can start work on their deck the moment they purchase it. The Content Direction feature provides step-by-step advice to create an engaging deck, whatever your goal, and the company provides support and assistance, as well as regular updates, so every customer knows they're getting the best value for money.

Figures collected by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) suggest that 150 million businesses are currently seeking funding. BaseTemplates not only provides these founders with the only all-in-one template to create professional pitch decks, but it also supplies presentation creators – academics, industry leaders and business executives – all over the world with a comprehensive solution to create the best presentations.

# Does Pitch Deck Design Really Matter?

The impressions we form in the first few seconds matter. Most investors will judge your pitch deck (and you) on appearance without even realizing it. This means that different colors, shapes and font styles all have a big impact on the success of your pitch.

Investors see hundreds of pitch presentations a year, and design is one of the easiest ways to ensure they remember yours. Good design enhances your story and makes the key points of the presentation stand out, communicating your story more clearly and effectively.

# Design Tips

Investors need to understand your slides within seconds of looking at them, so the amount of written content you include is critical. Always

Made with ♥ by basetemplates.com

# Chapter 4. Design

Choose images, charts and figures over writing and, if you do have to include written material, use as few words as possible.

Every deck slide should have the same style: margins, color scheme, font size, and visual assets. These small details ensure your presentation looks smart, professional and well considered.

# Page Margins

Avoid large or very small page margins, as this makes your slides look crowded. We recommend a margin between 1.5cm and 3cm.

# Color Scheme

Your color scheme should enhance your deck and complement your logo. Pick two or three main colors for your deck and use shades of the same color for variation. A highlighter color to showcase important content is also a great idea.

# Font Size

Choose no more than two font sizes; one for headings and another for everything else. Make sure all fonts can be seen from across a room (we recommend at least 50px) but are not so large that words are split between one line and the next.

# Visual Assets

Make sure you use high resolution images and avoid any that would not occur naturally. Charts, graphs, and diagrams must

# Chapter 4. Design

Complement your color scheme and fit neatly onto the slide. Avoid 3D images, which can be difficult to interpret.

# Slide Transitions and Animations

Avoid using transitions and animations, unless you have slides showing a complex process or data, in which case introducing elements one at a time can be helpful.

# Deck Formats

There are two types of pitch decks: presentation decks and reading decks.

# Presentation Deck

Contain very little information, it is designed to accompany a verbal pitch and should be used to highlight key points.

# Reading Deck

Is not presented to investors in person. It must include enough information to give readers a detailed overview of your business model, team, and solution.

As you would expect, some design tips work best for pitch presentations while others are better suited to reading decks. Here, we share some of the best design tips for both.

# Presentation Deck

When it comes to pitch decks, there is one point every successful founder should know – use as few words as possible. Your deck slides are there to introduce an idea; it is your verbal pitch that will provide the majority of the information. Always use images and charts instead of words and limit yourself to 10 words per slide.

# Reading Deck

A reading presentation deck has a lot of work to do. Investors should be able to glance at your deck and understand within minutes what your venture is about. The slides have to say everything you would have said in person in the shortest time possible.

Each slide has two purposes; to make a point, and to back it up with data. The most effective slides make one point and one point only. Using the same slide to deliver multiple ideas makes it harder to read and understand.

Select words carefully, each one must convey a meaning. Steer clear of useless adjectives and impressive phrases – investors should be able to see that your customer acquisition strategy is effective, your product exciting, you don't need to waste space on lengthy phrases.

# Tips for a Printed Deck

When it comes to the printed deck, presentation is everything. Take your deck slides to a print shop and get them properly bound. This shows investors how serious you are, and means your deck will remain neat and ordered no matter how many people thumb through it.

We recommend steel binding, which is the professional standard. If you can not find a print shop with a steel binder, then spiral binding is the next best option. Avoid comb binding, which can fall apart and do not, under any circumstances, use a staple.

Print your deck onto a heavy weight paper, we recommend over 120gsm, which makes your deck feel like a high-quality product. It is also less likely to cause paper cuts (an added benefit to investors). Each slide should have a page of its own, and you should include an

Made with ♥ by basetemplates.com
---
# Chapter 5. Delivery

additional 'overview' page which displays all the slides together for easy viewing.

# Tips for a Digital Deck

A digital presentation has one crucial difference to the printed deck; it can be viewed on screens as small as five inches and as large as 21.

# PDF

Smaller than Keynote and PowerPoint files, a PDF is the best format to deliver your digital deck in. The layout remains the same across Windows, Apple, and Android operating systems, plus you have the added benefit of a password protection option which gives you some degree of control over who views your deck.

We recommend using docsend.com, an analytics dashboard for documents that lets you keep track of who read your deck and how long they spent on it. It is also useful to host your deck on a cloud service like Dropbox and provide investors with an access link since this allows you to update the deck even after investors have received it.

Startup investor decks take time to create and even longer to practice.

# Chapter 6. Pitching Exercises

In 30 words or less, describe your venture. Sounds easy? Well, after those first 30 words, you can only speak again when your viewer asks you a question. And you only have 30 words to answer it with.

This exercise takes some practice, but it is ideal for thinking about the information you need in your pitch. Use your 30 words to encourage your viewer to ask another question, try to shape the direction of their questions until you have included all the key points you want an investor to know.

Optional: When you have finished, ask your viewer to summarize what they think your venture is about. Do they understand your idea? Is your business model clear? What else do they need to know?

Act 2: Every conference Max visits it's the same thing, a parade of boring bullet-point presentations. The problem is, not everyone knows where to find a professional designer to help him improve his pitch.

# Practice Makes Perfect

Time

Requires

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete pitch deck and a willing audience

Purpose

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn your pitch deck

A good pitch requires practice. Start by running through your pitch on your own. Once you know each of your presentation slides well, you can face a real audience. Ask them to interrupt you, to jump in with questions and demand extra facts and supporting data. Learn how to handle these interruptions without losing the momentum of your pitch.

Optional: Consider recording your presentation. Take note of the places where your pretend investors ask questions and the questions they ask. Could you prevent them from asking by reordering the slides or adding in new ones? Is something in your presentation deck unclear? How can you make your key points clearer?

# Types of Investors

For those seeking seed capital, there are five primary funding sources: friends and family, crowdfunding, accelerator programs, angel investors and venture capitals (VCs). Each group invests in startups at different stages and typically contribute varying levels of funding. As such, founders will need to consider which investor is best suited to their venture, its current needs and long-term objectives.

# Self Funded

Founders who support projects themselves maintain complete ownership of their businesses and don't have to accommodate others in the decision-making process. It is also the cheapest way to finance your venture. However, you may miss out on the networking opportunities and expert advice a successful seeding round can generate. Funds for these projects typically come from re-invested profits or 'bootstrapping', where founders sell other services and invest that revenue into the business.

# Friends and Family

Friends and family will most likely invest in your venture to support you, but you should make it clear that they are buying equity in your company, and how much. Make sure they understand the risks involved; most startups fail, and they probably won't get their money back.

Made with ♥ by basetemplates.com

# Chapter 7. Investors

Investments from friends and family are a great way to raise relatively small amounts – around $5,000 – for the initial startup phase.

# Crowdfunding

Platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter allow lots of strangers to invest small sums. With five-figure campaigns becoming more and more common, this funding method is growing in popularity among those looking to raise seed capital. Of course, no one wants something for nothing, and founders must choose whether to sell equity or reward backers with perks such as discounted products or early delivery. Campaigns only get funded if they meet their pledge goal. There is a high failure rate but, for those that are successful, there are additional benefits to running a campaign, which can be used to market a product, increase pre-sales, and test pricing.

# Accelerators

Accelerators don't invest in your venture to the same extent that an angel investor or venture capital might, but they do offer a gateway to funding. These closed groups provide selected startups with access to a network of mentors, investors, suppliers, vendors and other useful resources.
---
# Chapter 7. Investors

contacts. They also supply educational services and advice to help refine your business model.

Approved startups typically give up equity in exchange for access to an accelerator's network. When applying to an accelerator group, it is important to research them thoroughly. Many are industry specific, and some are a lot better than others.

# Angel Investors

Angel investors are wealthy individuals or small trusts that personally invest in your venture. They are often successful entrepreneurs and can provide valuable advice and industry contacts as well as seed funding.

An angel investor buys equity in your company in exchange for future profits but, unlike other financing methods, they often take an interest in business operations. As such, it is important to research angels before you approach them. Make sure any angel investors you consider.

# Chapter 7. Investors

Partnering with have a good reputation, as well as the skills and contacts to help your business grow.

# Venture Capitals (VCs)

Like angel investors, venture capitals provide seed funds in exchange for equity. Unlike angels, who typically commit relatively small sums (up to $500,000), venture capitals have the resources to invest millions of dollars in your business.

These firms pool money from institutional investors, pension funds and insurance companies and invest in high-risk enterprises. The high-risk nature of their investments mean they are expected to deliver their clients (i.e. the companies that contributed the money) very high returns. As such, VCs often take an active role in the direction of the company and may prioritize revenue over the founder's original vision.

# Approaching Investors

How you approach investors is critical. Cold calls and emails can ruin your chance of getting funded, seek personal introductions instead.

# Accelerators

You will find information on the accelerator application process on their website or by approaching them directly. Be selective about which groups you approach – submitting multiple applications is time-consuming and looks desperate.

Be sure to research the group before you apply; there are plenty of bad accelerator programs out there. Find out as much information as you can about their network and other startups they have worked with.

When you have found the right program, follow their instructions for joining and make sure your venture meets the program specifications before submitting.

# Angel Investors

Personal introductions are the best way to approach an angel investor. Use LinkedIn and your professional and personal networks to find a common connection who is willing to endorse you. If you don't have someone, then use conferences and industry events to seek an introduction. If all else fails, pick up the phone and try to arrange a meeting.

Made with ♥ by basetemplates.com

# Chapter 7. Investors

Remember, don't ask for money straight away. You are building a two-way relationship, and you need to know that any angel investor you partner with is the right fit for your business.

# Venture Capitals

Again, personal introductions work best. Venture Capitals are huge companies with large networks, so finding a common connection should be easier than with an angel investor.

These companies are regularly approached by startups so, when you do get an introduction, be ready to move quickly. Send a reading deck the same day that you exchange business cards and never go into a presentation pitch without additional documentation ready to send should the VC ask for it.

---
# Chapter 8. Action Plan

The actions you take to produce your finished pitch deck depends on its purpose. If you are pitching a concept, developing a prototype, or seeking seed capital, then your deck will begin with your initial idea. More established ventures will already have a working understanding of their business model and may choose to skip ahead, bypassing the prototype stage.

# 1. The Prototype

Consider how your business will run day-to-day; how it will make money and who your customers will be. Identify companies that are already producing similar products, who their clients are and the markets they trade in. Consider recent market trends and future predictions and define how your business will operate in this market. Don't worry about the story of your venture, pitch deck design or even which slides you will include at this point. Instead, focus on creating a simple deck that describes you, your idea, the problem it solves, the market, competitors and business model.

Congratulations! You have a prototype business.

# 2. Feedback and Advice

Ask friends, family and industry contacts to take a look at your pitch deck. Do they have any suggestions on how to improve your business.

model? Insight into the market? Would they like to see more information on one slide, or less? This step is about perfecting your business model, use the feedback from your network to adjust your pitch deck slides.

# 3. Define Your Story

The first step to creating your pitch deck is to decide which story it will tell. You will need different stories for different investors so draft two or three; The Hero's Journey, Customers Tale and Industry Point of View we showed you in chapter 3 make excellent starting points.

Write each story down and, once you are happy that it is perfect, split it into sections based on the deck slide types we discussed in part three. By dividing the story in this way, we have identified the slides we need to tell it and the order they should appear in the deck.

Remember, the story will develop as you create your deck, and you may find yourself adding or removing slides at a later date.

# 6. Approach Investors

Decide which type of investor is best suited to your venture (see chapter 7 for advice) and define your ask. Only approach business investors who are likely to support your startup. Create a list of the top 30 investors, any connections you have in common with them, and the conferences or industry events they are likely to attend. A personal introduction is the best way to approach investors.

# 7. Present Your Deck

Remember, the little things count. Printed decks should be printed on high quality paper and properly bound. Digital decks should be sent as a PDF file (see chapter 5 for more information). When presenting use PDF format as well and avoid native PowerPoint or Keynote formats, unless is really important to use animation features for your slides.
